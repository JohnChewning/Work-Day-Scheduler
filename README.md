# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Introduction

A Work Day Scheduler that allows the user to save hourly appointments from 9am-5pm.

## Project Overview

The goal with this project was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day(9am-5pm) by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Installation

Pushed the code into the github repository and deployed in into github pages. For review and grading purposes, the application is deployed at [(https://johnchewning.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/)](https://johnchewning.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/). 

## Usage

The current date and time are displayed at the top of the scheduler.
Underneath are timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am-5pm.
Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
Gray is a past event, Red is a present event, and Green is a future event.
When the user inputs information to create an appointment, the data is saved in local storage. When you refresh the page, the saved events will persist.

## Challenges

jQuery is a great tool to implement javascript. Carefully reading the documentation and learning the syntax was challenging, but also, fun. Using Day.js to update the current date and time on the page is a very cool feature.

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to use Day.js and jQuery to create a dynamic Work Day Scheduler.

## Future Development

I want to add an alert to show the appointment has been saved in the local storage like the example in the project README.
